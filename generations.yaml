generations:
  - name: "First Generation (E150)"
    start_year: 2006
    end_year: 2012
    description: "The first-generation Toyota Auris was introduced as a replacement for the Corolla hatchback in European and some Asian markets, though the Corolla nameplate continued in sedan form and in other regions. Designed specifically to appeal to European tastes and compete with popular hatchbacks like the Volkswagen Golf, the Auris featured more dynamic styling than the Corolla it replaced, with a shorter, taller body profile and distinctive character lines. Available as a five-door hatchback (with a three-door variant added later in some markets), the Auris was built on Toyota's MC platform shared with the contemporary Corolla. Engine options varied by market but typically included 1.4-liter and 1.6-liter gasoline engines, a 1.8-liter in higher trim levels (including a hybrid variant introduced in 2010), and 1.4-liter and 2.0-liter diesel options popular in European markets. The hybrid version, known as Auris Hybrid, was notable as the first mass-produced hybrid vehicle in the compact segment from a mainstream manufacturer. A facelift in 2010 brought revised exterior styling, improved interior materials, and enhanced equipment levels."

  - name: "Second Generation (E180)"
    start_year: 2012
    end_year: 2018
    description: "The second-generation Toyota Auris featured more distinctive, angular styling as part of Toyota's effort to create more emotionally appealing designs under the direction of President Akio Toyoda. Built on an updated version of the MC platform, the new Auris adopted a lower, wider stance with a more aggressive front end featuring sharper headlights and a prominent grille. Available in five-door hatchback and wagon (Touring Sports) body styles, the latter being a new addition to the lineup, the Auris grew slightly in length while reducing height for improved proportions and aerodynamics. Engine options continued to include small-displacement gasoline and diesel units, with the hybrid powertrain becoming increasingly important to the model mix. The interior saw improvements in design and material quality, adopting a more horizontal dashboard layout with softer touch surfaces. A facelift in 2015 brought revised exterior styling, new engine options including a 1.2-liter turbocharged gasoline unit, and further interior refinements."

  - name: "Third Generation (E210)"
    start_year: 2019
    end_year: 2020
    description: "The third-generation Auris is based on the Toyota New Global Architecture (TNGA) platform, representing a significant step forward in driving dynamics and refinement. Unveiled as a pre-production model in March 2018 at the Geneva Motor Show, this generation marked the first use of TNGA for the C-segment hatchback. The Auris nameplate was discontinued across Europe with this generation, replaced by the Corolla nameplate starting January 2019. However, the Auris name continued in Taiwan from September 2018 to July 2020. The Taiwanese market version was powered by a 2.0-liter M20A-FKS petrol engine mated to a simulated 10-speed Direct Shift CVT, equipped with Toyota Safety Sense (TSS), vehicle stability control, traction control, hill-start assist, head-up display, push start, and smart entry systems. The E210 platform offered improved driving dynamics, a lower center of gravity, and enhanced safety features compared to its predecessors."
