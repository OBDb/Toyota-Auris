    description: "The first-generation Toyota Auris was introduced as a replacement for the Corolla hatchback in European and some Asian markets, though the Corolla nameplate continued in sedan form and in other regions. Designed specifically to appeal to European tastes and compete with popular hatchbacks like the Volkswagen Golf, the Auris featured more dynamic styling than the Corolla it replaced, with a shorter, taller body profile and distinctive character lines. Available as a five-door hatchback (with a three-door variant added later in some markets), the Auris was built on Toyota's MC platform shared with the contemporary Corolla. Engine options varied by market but typically included 1.4-liter and 1.6-liter gasoline engines, a 1.8-liter in higher trim levels (including a hybrid variant introduced in 2010), and 1.4-liter and 2.0-liter diesel options popular in European markets. Transmission choices included five and six-speed manuals, four-speed automatic, and continuously variable transmission (CVT) for the hybrid. The interior prioritized practicality with a raised center console containing the gear shifter, creating a distinctive 'bridge' design element, while material quality was improved over the previous Corolla to better compete with European rivals. The hybrid version, known as Auris Hybrid, was notable as the first mass-produced hybrid vehicle in the compact segment from a mainstream manufacturer, utilizing a modified version of the Prius drivetrain. A facelift in 2010 brought revised exterior styling, improved interior materials, and enhanced equipment levels. The first-generation Auris established the model as Toyota's core C-segment offering in Europe, providing characteristic Toyota reliability and efficiency in a package better tailored to European design preferences, though it faced criticism for uninspiring driving dynamics compared to some rivals."

    description: "The second-generation Toyota Auris featured more distinctive, angular styling as part of Toyota's effort to create more emotionally appealing designs under the direction of President Akio Toyoda. Built on an updated version of the MC platform, the new Auris adopted a lower, wider stance with a more aggressive front end featuring sharper headlights and a prominent grille. Available in five-door hatchback and wagon (Touring Sports) body styles, the latter being a new addition to the lineup, the Auris grew slightly in length while reducing height for improved proportions and aerodynamics. Engine options continued to include small-displacement gasoline and diesel units, with the hybrid powertrain becoming increasingly important to the model mix, eventually accounting for over 50% of Auris sales in many European markets. The hybrid system paired a 1.8-liter Atkinson cycle engine with an electric motor for a combined 136 horsepower, providing significantly lower emissions than conventional powertrainsâ€”a key selling point in tax-conscious European markets. The interior saw improvements in design and material quality, adopting a more horizontal dashboard layout with softer touch surfaces and available technology including Toyota's Touch 2 infotainment system. A significant facelift in 2015 brought revised exterior styling, new engine options including a 1.2-liter turbocharged gasoline unit, and further interior refinements. The second-generation Auris continued Toyota's strategy of offering a reliable, practical alternative to mainstream European hatchbacks, with the hybrid variant in particular finding success as awareness of emissions and running costs increased among consumers. However, the model continued to be perceived as less engaging to drive than key competitors like the Volkswagen Golf and Ford Focus, positioning it as a sensible rather than aspirational choice in the competitive compact segment."
